    <h5>Minimizing Lanfills</h5>
    <p>Landfills are where garbage is destined to go once it’s carted away, but they are far from the most environmentally friendly places to send waste. Space is limited, and most landfills aren’t very good at encouraging decomposition. Fortunately, there are a few ways that you can help cut down on the amount of waste that gets shuttled off to landfills.</p><br>
    <p>Items such as plastic, paper, glass and aluminium cans can easily be recycled. Dispose of them correctly in the recycle bins. You can even have your own recycle bin at home and sensitise your family on correct disposal.</p><br>
    <p>You should dispose of organic materials from your kitchen in your garden. Decomposing organic remains can be used as fertiliser instead of being sent to the landfills</p><br>
    <p>You can opt not to receive unwanted mail by contacting the relevant authorities available in your area. This will reduce unnecessary disposal of papers</p><br>
