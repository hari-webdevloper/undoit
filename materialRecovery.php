<section class="c_2">
The Undo it is dedicated to accelerating the circular economy, by recovering resources from the waste, thereby preventing unwanted landfills. To achieve that, The Undo it comes as a management partner for the MRF - Material Recovery Facility where the waste collected by the local municipality vehicles from various households, businesses, institutions, and other bulk waste generators, are stored at MRF centres for further processing and then considering the nature of recovered materials, sent for recycling and reuse.<br><br><br><br>

Currently, The Kabadiwala manages 5 crucial city waste spots - MRF Centres in an unprecedented collaboration with the Urban Local Bodies, which has contributed to formalising the unorganised sector by employing waste workers with an aim to provide them with better working conditions and dignified life opportunities.<br><br><br><br>

If not managing directly, The Undo it helps by providing consultancy services to formulate the plan of action on integrative management of mixed-up resources & joining the open loop of the linear economy to generate revenue and environmental solutions into the bargain.<br><br><br><br>
