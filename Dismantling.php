For the sustainable disposal of the scrap, the dismantling process plays the most critical part where dismantled items are segregated into marketable fractions to be repaired and reused, while the rest of the hazardous components are removed from end-of-life products and securely transferred to the authorised recyclers to prevent them from ending up in our dumping grounds which otherwise not just pollute our environment but also create a grave occupational hazard for the waste workers. The nature of the recyclables are carefully taken into account before sending them to the concerned recyclers for their right disposal.<br><br><br><br>
To preserve our environment from the draconian impact of waste pollution, The Undo it through its dismantling service offers a holistic approach to implement circular solutions to the scrap disposal, which begins with the effective collection, dismantling, reuse, and finally, recycling of the procured non-usable materials. The focus being that the device is dismantled up to the point where no further extraction of the usable component is possible without mechanical shredding. This is a revenue-centric model that reduces the burden on the environment, prevents toxicity, and generates value.<br><br><br><br>
Apart from dismantling, The Undo it team is engaged in carrying out the overall pre-processing of the recycling service, to later send the baled material to the authorised recyclers for further processing.<br><br><br>
